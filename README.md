# Simulating bacteria behavior in Google Colab using agent-based models 

A collection of interactive Google Colab notebooks for teaching and exploring agent-based models (ABMs) of living organisms, with a focus on bacterial behavior. These scripts are designed for high school students and educators interested in computational biology, microbiology, and simulation-based learning.

## Overview

This repository provides a set of Python notebooks that introduce agent-based modeling concepts using bacteria as a model system. Students can simulate, visualize, and analyze how simple behavioral rules in individual bacteria lead to complex population-level phenomena, such as chemotaxis, growth, and biofilm formation.

These resources are ideal for classroom use, workshops, or self-guided exploration, and require no prior experience with agent-based modeling or advanced programming.

## Features

- **Step-by-step, beginner-friendly notebooks**  
- **Interactive simulations** using [Mesa](https://mesa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) (a Python ABM library)
- **Visualization tools** for real-time observation of bacterial movement and population dynamics
- **Parameter controls** for hands-on experimentation
- **Exploratory exercises** and discussion prompts for deeper learning

---

## Notebooks

- **1. Random Bacterial Movement:**  
  Introduction to ABM with bacteria moving randomly in a simulated environment.

- **2. Bacterial Chemotaxis:**  
  Simulation of the classic "run and tumble" chemotaxis, where bacteria sense and respond to chemical gradients.

- **3. Bacterial Growth and Division:**  
  Model of bacterial population dynamics, including resource consumption and cell division.

- **4. Biofilm Formation:**  
  Advanced model showing how bacteria communicate and form structured communities.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or download this repository** to your computer, or open the notebooks directly in Google Colab.
2. **Open a notebook** (e.g., `script2-bacterial-chemotaxis.ipynb`) in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/).
3. **Run the cells** sequentially. The notebooks will guide you through installation, simulation, and analysis steps.

**Requirements:**
- Google Colab account (recommended)
- Python 3.x (if running locally)
- Mesa, NumPy, Matplotlib (will be auto-installed in Colab)

---

## Usage

- **Educators:**  
  Use these notebooks as interactive lessons or lab activities. Each script contains explanatory comments and suggested exercises.

- **Students:**  
  Experiment with simulation parameters, observe emergent behaviors, and answer reflection questions to deepen your understanding.

- **Contributors:**
