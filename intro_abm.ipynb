    "## Understanding Agent-Based Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent-based modeling (ABM) is a computational approach that simulates the actions and interactions of autonomous agents to assess their effects on the system as a whole. ABMs are used in biology, ecology, social sciences, economics, and many other fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key components of an agent-based model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Agents**: Individual entities with properties and behaviors\n",
    "2. **Environment**: The space where agents exist and interact\n",
    "3. **Rules**: Define how agents behave and interact with each other and the environment\n",
    "4. **Time**: The simulation progresses in discrete steps\n",
    "\n",
    "ABMs are particularly useful for studying complex systems where the collective behavior emerges from simple individual rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use ABMs for studying bacteria?\n",
    "\n",
    "Bacteria are excellent candidates for agent-based modeling because:\n",
    "- They behave as individual entities with simple rules\n",
    "- Their interactions with the environment and each other lead to complex patterns\n",
    "- We can observe emergent behaviors like chemotaxis, biofilm formation, and antibiotic resistance\n",
    "- ABMs let us test hypotheses that would be difficult or time-consuming in a lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing a Simple Bacterial Movement Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In our first model, we'll create a simple representation of bacteria moving randomly in a 2D environment. This models the natural random motion (Brownian motion) that bacteria exhibit when not responding to specific stimuli."

    "## Extensions and Exercises for Students\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some exercises to extend your understanding of agent-based modeling with bacteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Modify the movement pattern**: Change the `move()` method in the `BacteriumAgent` class to implement different movement patterns. For example, you could make bacteria prefer to move in the same direction as their last move.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Add energy consumption**: Modify the bacterial agent to consume energy when moving. Bacteria will need to rest or find food to replenish energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Add reproduction**: When a bacterium has enough energy, it can reproduce by creating a new bacterium in a neighboring cell using `BacteriumAgent(self.model)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Add death**: Bacteria can die when they run out of energy or reach a certain age. Use `self.remove()` to remove agents from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Add an environmental factor**: Create an environmental factor like temperature or pH that affects bacterial movement or survival.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Use AgentSet features**: Experiment with Mesa 3.x's powerful AgentSet functionality:\n",
    "   - Filter bacteria by energy: `high_energy_bacteria = self.agents.select(lambda a: a.energy > 50)`\n",
    "   - Group bacteria by type: `grouped = self.agents.groupby(\"species\")`\n",
    "   - Calculate statistics: `avg_energy = self.agents.agg(\"energy\", func=np.mean)`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Questions for Reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What patterns do you observe in the bacterial distribution over time?\n",
    "2. How does changing the number of bacteria affect the grid occupancy?\n",
    "3. How does the speed parameter affect the bacteria's spreading pattern?\n",
    "4. What real-world bacterial behaviors might this simple model represent?\n",
    "5. What limitations does this model have compared to real bacterial movement?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "In this  notebook, you've learned:\n",
    "- Basic concepts of agent-based modeling\n",
    "- How to implement a simple bacterial movement model using Mesa 3.x\n",
    "- How to visualize and analyze the model's behavior\n",
    "- How to experiment with different parameters to see their effects\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next notebook, we'll explore bacterial chemotaxis - how bacteria sense and move toward or away from chemical gradients in their environment."
